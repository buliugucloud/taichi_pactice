This repo is created to record my practice using taichi programing language.
Most of the examples are from "Taichi Course 01"(https://docs.taichi.graphics/tgc01), which I both read the code carefully and annotated according to my understanding.
However, there are also some example I wrote by myself base on the examples given by "Taichi Course 01" .
